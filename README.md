# Tw-ImgStat
A (hopefully) simple .NET twitter scraper &amp; image analyzer.

Currently non-functional. Code is *very* WIP and comments are scarce. 

Requires an `Auth.txt` file to be placed in the application directory with the following format:
```
CONSUMER_TOKEN={Your Twitter Consumer Key} 
CONSUMER_SECRET={Your Twitter Consumer Secret Key} 
ACCESS_TOKEN={Your Twitter Access Token}
ACCESS_SECRET={Your Twitter Consumer Secret Access Token}
```
