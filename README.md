# Tw-ImgStat
A (hopefully) simple .NET twitter scraper &amp; image analyzer. As seen on that one AP Capstone Research paper if that ever turns up in a proper academic site or something.

Currently non-functional as a binary. Code is *very* WIP and comments are scarce. You'll have to comment out sections of the main function to access the three modes of ImgStat.

Requires an `Auth.txt` file to be placed in the application directory with the following format:
```
CONSUMER_TOKEN={Your Twitter Consumer Key} 
CONSUMER_SECRET={Your Twitter Consumer Secret Key} 
ACCESS_TOKEN={Your Twitter Access Token}
ACCESS_SECRET={Your Twitter Consumer Secret Access Token}
```

This code is provided as-is and is unlikely to receive any updates or support.
